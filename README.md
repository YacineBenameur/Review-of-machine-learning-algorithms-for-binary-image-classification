# Review-of-machine-learning-algorithms-for-binary-image-classification
The success of Deep learning is essentially due to outperforming other machine learning algorithms in the task of image classification[6].That's why, In this repository, we will use binary image classification to benchmark different machine learning algorithms including deep learning. We will Investigating how "classical" ML algorithms can be deployed to tackle this problem, compare them and see how their hyperparameters can be tuned to increase their performance. We will follow the same path with the deep learning approach.

The workflow is designed as follow :

Import and visualize dataset (airplanes and cars images from the opensource dataset CIFAR-10).
Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
Testing different ML algorithms.
Convolutional neural networks.
Conclusion.
